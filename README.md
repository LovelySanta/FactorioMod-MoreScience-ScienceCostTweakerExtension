This mod changes the technology tree. The research dependencies are still the same, but the recipe ingredients are different. The goal of this is to make new science buildings. That way you have something else for a change.

# Extension
This mod is an extension to the [More Science](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/MoreScience) to make the ScienceCostTweaker mod work together with MoreScience.
This mod requires the mod More Science installed.
